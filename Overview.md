# Overview
## Purpose
The purpose of this page is to list the possible tracks in cybersecurity and highlight relevant training options along with achievable certifications.
## About the tracks
Hereafter a non exhaustive list of tracks one could consider to start a career in cybersecurity.
- __Offensive Security__: often referred to as "red teaming" (wrongly), this is among the most popular tracks nowadays, yet most likely the most difficult to get started with due to its requirements in term of experience and technical level.
You'll try to think like a malicious actor and use the tools and techniques a hacker would use against your company's assets to eventually recommend possible changes to the security controls and enhance the security posture.
- __Cyber Defense__: often refered to as "blue team", you'll be defending your company against the numerous cyber threat by leveraging logs, alerts, proactive monitoring and other techniques.
Blue Team members often work in a SOC (Security Operations Center) and use tools such as SIEM/SOAR to handle security events and treat them.
- __Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)__: a less popular part of cybersecurity but yet an important one (if not the most important). You'll be in charge of defining the various policies for your company, and help the stakeholders to abide to them. You'll also participate in defining how the compliance to those policies/standards will be enforced and take care of most audit activities.
